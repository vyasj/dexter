Dexter is a Pokedex-like tool that has knowledge of all Pokemon and can recognize them based on an image. It's a Pokemon encyclopedia!

This is kind of just for my inner child, since I love Pokemon and wanted a database of sorts to use for any related projects down the line. I have a few in mind that could use this for sure.
