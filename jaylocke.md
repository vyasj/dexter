# Starterlocke+

## Concept
3 runs each of:
- (gen 1) FireRed/LeafGreen
- (gen 2) HeartGold/SoulSilver
- (gen 3) Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald
- (gen 4) Diamond/Pearl/Platinum
- (gen 5) Black/White/Black 2/White 2
- (gen 6) X/Y
In any generation order (Ex. gen 1, gen 4, gen 3, gen 6, gen 5, gen 2)

## Standard rules:
- Standard Nuzlocke rules
- Your starter MUST remain on your team at all times, if it dies then the run for that game ends.
- You must play each group of games 3 times, once for each starter. (Ex. Gen 3: FRLG 3 times, RSE 3 times)
- Gym leaders and E4/Champ are called 'Checkpoints'
- Whichever pokemon you use to beat a checkpoint CANNOT be used in ANY future runs. (Ex. use Diglett to beat Surge in run 2 of FR, can't use diglett line in any game from that point onward, but can still use diglett line in run 2 of FR)
- If a pokemon dies during/outside of a checkpoint battle, it can be used in future game runs.

## Hardcore rules:
- Standard Hardcore Nuzlocke rules
- If your starter dies, you start the entire generation over.

## Masochist rules:
- Randomize all pokemon and items
- Cannot use the same held item within the same generation. (Ex. use Charcoal in HGSS to beat a checkpoint, cannot use Charcoal for the remaining runs of HGSS)
- Expand definition of 'Checkpoints' to include rival battles and evil team boss battles.
